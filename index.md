# Welcome to Bichi's Very First Personal Webpage!

## Self Intro
Welcome to my personal page! My name is Bichi. I am passionate about sensor fusion, autonomous driving, data science, signal processing, and machine learning. 
In order to present myself better, I will list some information about myself, some of my previous projects on [Github](https://github.com/AncientreeBILL), and my resume. 

I graduated from TU Delft Electrical Engineering with a master's degree in 2021. From 2015-2019 I studied at Jilin University in Changchun, China. In the academic year 2018-2019,  I went for a one-year exchange opportunity at Ecole Centrale de Nantes in France, majoring in Signal, Control and Robotics. In the 2019 summer, I graduated from Jilin University with a Bachelor of Science degree, majoring in electronic information science and technology. 

During my thesis, I investigated the current Camera-LiDAR calibration algorithms. Together with my supervisor [Dr. Rajan](https://cas.tudelft.nl/People/bio.php?id=59), we proposed a novel camera-LiDAR calibration pipeline named Multi-FEAT (Multi-Feature Edge AlignmenT). Multi-FEAT addresses the misalignment feature-based calibration methods by exploiting the point cloud information as much as possible while maintaining the computational cost in a reasonable range.
The original thesis is publically available on [TU Delft Repository](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:b9da4c50-55c8-4d6b-9c20-68b51237db76?collection=education), but a more concise version will be released on arXiv soon. 

Currently, I work as Perception & Sensor Fusion Engineer at XPENG Motors in Guangzhou, China. Our team focuses on some critical challenges in sensor fusion, such as moving object tracking, drivable space mapping, and semantic SLAM. I've spent some time on the classic ORB-SLAM2, meanwhile dedicated to the occupancy grid map construction given multiple sensor inputs. We use C++ to implement our algorithms, testing the performance on actual vehicles with help from other teams. We also collect corner cases so that we can constantly improve our algorithms. I am very proud that several of my programs are running on more than 200,000 customers' sedans!

I am not a typical geek-like "coder", but I am constantly learning! Code simplifies how we work and changes how we interact with computers and other people. I mainly code in python environment to validate different mathematical models and ideas. I also use python to perform big data analysis/visualization and machine learning / deep learning tasks. Besides, I did quite some extensive course projects using Matlab. I will upload several interesting ones on my personal Github repositories. 

I also have some experience with C language for embedded systems. Aside from that, I've accomplished some small projects on 51 single-chip machines based on assembly language. I did several small student projects on an Arduino board for embedded systems, such as controlling digital screens and light-emitting diodes. In addition, I occasionally play with some algorithm problems on Leetcode, such as maze problems or dynamic programming. It is an excellent way to train my skills in thinking and designing more efficient code segments. This activity helps me fresh my mind as well.


## Previous Projects
- [Image Mosaic](https://github.com/AncientreeBILL/Image-Mosaic)
    - It is an project mainly on using small images from CIFAR dataset to replace the pixels in the target image. In order to make the original image alike the previous one, some rules on color intensities values must be followed.

- PID Control Tools (To be completed)

- Point Cloud Colorization (To be completed)

- Visualization of the Hague
    - It is the Geo-data visualization of river systems and public transport of the Hague. 
    - The result of this project is chosen to be shown on the [TU Delft course website](https://cusp.tbm.tudelft.nl/teaching/) as a banner image.

<!--## Something I am recently doing during my free time...
1. Learn C++ and ROS
2. Organize all my studies into digital fashion.
3. Get used to Github and this workflow.
4. Improve this page with HTML and CSS (This page is powered by Jekyll with a markdown file. I am picking up some HTML and CSS to improve it into a more fabulous one) -->
