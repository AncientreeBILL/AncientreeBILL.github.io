# Welcome to Bichi's Very First Personal Webpage!

## Self_Intro
My name is Bichi. Welcome to my personal page. I list some information of myself, some of my previous projects and my resume, so you can know me better. 
I graduated from TU Delft Electrical Engineering with a master degree in 2021. 


I am not a traditional geek-like "coder" but I am learning these new stuffs! Code simplifies how we work and changes how we interact with computers as well as other people. I mainly code in matlab and python environments to validate different mathematical models. I also have some experiences with C language and embedded systems. I did learn something more traditional, for example, assmbly language. Some small projects on 51 single-chip machine were based on this language. To be honest, I am not a fan of it. For embedded systems, I prefer something simpler. I did several small student projects based on an Arduino board, such as digital screen control and light-emitting diodes for indication. The style of code is more like C language, which is much more comfortable.

I have also used ROS in Ubuntu, collaborating with my teammate on a drone simulation project. 
In addition, I occasionally play with some problems on Leetcode, such as maze problem or dynamic programming. This activity helps me fresh my mind.
I am interested in signal processing, sensor fusion, autonomous driving and AI.
