# Welcome to Bichi's Very First Personal Webpage!

## Self Intro
Welcome to my personal page! My name is Bichi. I am passionate about sensor fusion, autonomous driving, data science, signal processing, and machine learning. 
In order to present me better, I will list some information about myself, some of my previous projects on [Github](https://github.com/AncientreeBILL), and my resume. 

I graduated from TU Delft Electrical Engineering with a master's degree in 2021. From 2015-2019 I studied at Jilin University in Changchun, China. In the academic year 2018-2019,  I went for a one-year exchange opportunity in Ecole Centrale de Nantes in France, majoring in Signal, Control and Robotics. In the 2019 summer, I graduated from Jilin University with a Bachelor of Science degree, majoring in electronic information science and technology. 


I am not a typical geek-like "coder", but I am constantly learning! Code simplifies how we work and changes how we interact with computers as well as other people. I mainly code in python environment to validate different mathematical models and ideas. I also use python to perform some big data analysis/visualization and machine learning / deep learning tasks. Besides, I did quite some extensive course projects using Matlab. I will upload several interesting ones on my personal Github repositories. 

I also have some experience with C language for embedded systems. Aside from that, I've learned something even more traditional, for example, assembly language. Some small projects on 51 single-chip machines were developed based on this language. I did several small student projects on an Arduino board for embedded systems, such as controlling digital screens and light-emitting diodes. The style of code is a C-like language, which is simpler. I have also used ROS in Ubuntu, collaborating with my teammate on a drone simulation project. 

In addition, I occasionally play with some algorithm problems on Leetcode, such as maze problems or dynamic programming. It is an excellent way to train my skills in thinking and designing more efficient code segments. This activity helps me fresh my mind as well.


## Previous Projects
- [Image Mosaic](https://github.com/AncientreeBILL/Image-Mosaic)
    - It is an project mainly on using small images from CIFAR dataset to replace the pixels in the target image. In order to make the original image alike the previous one, some rules on color intensities values must be followed.

- PID Control Tools (To be completed)

- Point Cloud Colorization (To be completed)

- Visualization of the Hague.
    - It is the Geo-data visualization of river systems and public transport of the Hague. 
    - The result of this project is chosen to be shown on the [TU Delft course website](https://cusp.tbm.tudelft.nl/teaching/) as a banner image.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/AncientreeBILL/AncientreeBILL.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Support or Contact

Having trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://docs.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) or [contact support](https://support.github.com/contact) and weâ€™ll help you sort it out. -->

## Something I am recently doing during my free time...
1. Learn C++ and ROS
2. Organize all my studies into digital fashion.
3. Get used to Github and this workflow.
4. Improve this page with HTML and CSS (This page is powered by Jekyll with a markdown file. I am picking up some HTML and CSS to improve it into a more fabulous one)
